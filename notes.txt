Go through Comichron and identify when table format changes.  Should just be column headers? DONE

Create database schemas

Decide where to host the damn thing.  PythonAnywhere has some good tools, but the Beelink gives me total control.
Is this where I learn Docker?

Thoughts on the actual code bit:
Create comic as class.  Class attributes: issue number, on-sale date (month, year), publisher, price, title, units sold DONE

Or do I want to do comic as class, issue as sub-class?
Potential advantage: define class method to pull all sales data, maybe even plot attrition curve.

IMPORTANT: combined sales figs are broken out at the bottom of the table.  Need to re-work logic to discard table entries outside top 500.

Can I update the scrape method to pull dynamically based on position of relevant column header? DONE

Figure out how to add date to class information.  Month & year generated in get_urls() function - pass as return?
