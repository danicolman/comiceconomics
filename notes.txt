Go through Comichron and identify when table format changes.  Should just be column headers?
Create database schemas
Decide where to host the damn thing.  PythonAnywhere has some good tools, but the Beelink gives me total control.
Is this where I learn Docker?

Thoughts on the actual code bit:
Create comic as class.  Class attributes: issue number, on-sale date (month, year), publisher, price, title, units sold

Or do I want to do comic as class, issue as sub-class?
Potential advantage: define class method to pull all sales data, maybe even plot attrition curve.
